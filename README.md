# ExploratoryDataAnalysis

In the first part of this lab, I explore honey production in the US from 1998-2012 while considering the following questions:

1. How has honey production yield changed from 1998 to 2012?
2. Over time, which states produce the most honey? Which produce the least? Which have experienced the most change in honey yield?
3. Does the data show any trends in terms of the number of honey producing colonies and yield per colony before vs. after 2006, which was when concern over Colony Collapse Disorder spread nationwide?
4. Are there any patterns that can be observed between total honey production and value of production over this time period?
5. How has value of production, which in some sense could be tied to demand, changed over this time period?

In the second part of the lab, I build a simple linear regression model using the built in 'cars' dataset. I evaluate the 
accuracy of the model by making predictions on a new set of data.
